"These concepts are common to all uses of Ansible, including network "
"automation. You need to understand them to use Ansible for network "
"automation. This basic introduction provides the background you need to "
"follow the examples in this guide."

"Any machine with Ansible installed. You can run commands and playbooks, "
"invoking ``/usr/bin/ansible`` or ``/usr/bin/ansible-playbook``, from any "
"control node. You can use any computer that has Python installed on it as"
" a control node - laptops, shared desktops, and servers can all run "
"Ansible. However, you cannot use a Windows machine as a control node. You"
" can have multiple control nodes."

"A list of managed nodes. An inventory file is also sometimes called a "
