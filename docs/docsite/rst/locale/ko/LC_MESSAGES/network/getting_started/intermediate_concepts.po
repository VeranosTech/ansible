"This page introduces some concepts that help you manage your Ansible "
"workflow: roles, directory structure, and source control. Like the Basic "
"Concepts at the beginning of this guide, these intermediate concepts are "
"common to all uses of Ansible. This page also offers resources for "
"learning more."

"Roles are sets of Ansible defaults, files, tasks, templates, variables, "
"and other Ansible components that work together. As you saw on the "
"Working with Playbooks page, moving from a command to a playbook makes it"
" easy to run multiple tasks and repeat the same tasks in the same order. "
"Moving from a playbook to a role makes it even easier to reuse and share "
"your ordered tasks. For more details, see the :doc:`documentation on "
"roles<../../user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles>`. You can also look at "
":doc:`Ansible Galaxy<../../reference_appendices/galaxy>`, which lets you "
"share your roles and use others' roles, either directly or as "
"inspiration."

"As you expand your inventory, roles and playbooks, you should place your "
"Ansible projects under source control. We recommend ``git`` for source "
"control. ``git`` provides an audit trail, letting you track changes, roll"
" back mistakes, view history and share the workload of managing, "
"maintaining and expanding your Ansible ecosystem. There are plenty of "
"tutorials and guides to using ``git`` available."
