"As you expand your inventory, roles and playbooks, you should place your "
"Ansible projects under source control. We recommend ``git`` for source "
"control. ``git`` provides an audit trail, letting you track changes, roll"
" back mistakes, view history and share the workload of managing, "
"maintaining and expanding your Ansible ecosystem. There are plenty of "
"tutorials and guides to using ``git`` available."

#~ "Roles are sets of Ansible defaults, "
#~ "files, tasks, templates, variables, and "
#~ "other Ansible components that work "
#~ "together. As you saw on the "
#~ "Working with Playbooks page, moving from"
#~ " a command to a playbook makes "
#~ "it easy to run multiple tasks and"
#~ " repeat the same tasks in the "
#~ "same order. Moving from a playbook "
#~ "to a role makes it even easier "
#~ "to reuse and share your ordered "
#~ "tasks. For more details, see the "
#~ ":doc:`documentation on "
#~ "roles<../../user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles>`. You can"
#~ " also look at :doc:`Ansible "
#~ "Galaxy<../../reference_appendices/galaxy>`, which lets "
#~ "you share your roles and use "
#~ "others' roles, either directly or as "
#~ "inspiration."
