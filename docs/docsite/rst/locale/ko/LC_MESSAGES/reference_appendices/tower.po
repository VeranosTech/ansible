"Tower allows you to control access to who can access what, even allowing "
"sharing of SSH credentials without someone being able to transfer those "
"credentials.  Inventory can be graphically managed or synced with a wide "
"variety of cloud sources.  It logs all of your jobs, integrates well with"
" LDAP, and has an amazing browsable REST API.  Command line tools are "
"available for easy integration with Jenkins as well.  Provisioning "
"callbacks provide great support for autoscaling topologies."
