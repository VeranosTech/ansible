"Roles are units of organization in Ansible.  Assigning a role to a group "
"of :term:`hosts <Host>` (or a set of :term:`groups <group>`, or "
":term:`host patterns <Globbing>`, etc.) implies that they should "
"implement a specific behavior.  A role may include applying certain "
"variable values, certain :term:`tasks`, and certain :term:`handlers` -- "
"or just one or more of these things.  Because of the file structure "
"associated with a role, roles become redistributable units that allow you"
