"Every community can be strengthened by a diverse variety of viewpoints, "
"insights, opinions, skillsets, and skill levels. However, with diversity "
"comes the potential for disagreement and miscommunication. The purpose of"
" this Code of Conduct is to ensure that disagreements and differences of "
"opinion are conducted respectfully and on their own merits, without "
"personal attacks or other behavior that might create an unsafe or "
"unwelcoming environment."

"These policies are not designed to be a comprehensive set of Things You "

"All Ansible events and participants therein are governed by this Code of "
"Conduct and anti-harassment policy. We expect organizers to enforce these"
" guidelines throughout all events, and we expect attendees, speakers, "
"sponsors, and volunteers to help ensure a safe environment for our whole "
"community. Specifically, this Code of Conduct covers participation in all"
" Ansible-related forums and mailing lists, code and documentation "
"contributions, public IRC channels, private correspondence, and public "
"meetings."

"Asynchronous communication can come with its own frustrations, even in "

" largely built on volunteered time, and that questions, contributions, "
"and requests for support may take some time to receive a response. "
"Repeated \"bumps\" or \"reminders\" in rapid succession are not good "
"displays of patience. Additionally, it is considered poor manners to ping"
" a specific person with general questions. Pose your question to the "
"community as a whole, and wait patiently for a response."

"The only stupid question is the one that does not get asked. We encourage"

" ask a question (the answer is always yes!), instead, simply ask your "
"question. You are encouraged to provide as many specifics as possible. "
"Code snippets in the form of Gists or other paste site links are almost "
"always needed in order to get the most helpful answers. Refrain from "
"pasting multiple lines of code directly into the IRC channels - instead "
"use gist.github.com or another paste site to provide code snippets."

"The Ansible community is committed to being a welcoming environment for "

"time, and our community cannot grow without an environment where new "
"users feel safe and comfortable asking questions. It can become "
"frustrating to answer the same questions repeatedly; however, community "
"members are expected to remain courteous and helpful to all users "
"equally, regardless of skill or knowledge level. Avoid providing "
"responses that prioritize snideness and snark over useful information. At"
" the same time, everyone is expected to read the provided documentation "
"thoroughly. We are happy to answer questions, provide strategic guidance,"
" and suggest effective workflows, but we are not here to do your job for "
"you."
