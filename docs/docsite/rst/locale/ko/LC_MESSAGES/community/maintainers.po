"When you contribute a new module to the `ansible/ansible "
"<https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`_ repository, you become the "
"maintainer for that module once it has been merged. Maintainership "
"empowers you with the authority to accept, reject, or request revisions "
"to pull requests on your module -- but as they say, \"with great power "
"comes great responsibility.\""

#: ../../rst/community/maintainers.rst:22

"Maintainers of Ansible modules are expected to provide feedback, "
"responses, or actions on pull requests or issues to the module(s) they "
"maintain in a reasonably timely manner."

msgid ""
"It is also recommended that you occasionally revisit the `contribution "
"guidelines "
"<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_,"
" as they are continually refined. Occasionally, you may be requested to "
"update your module to move it closer to the general accepted standard "
"requirements. We hope for this to be infrequent, and will always be a "
"request with a fair amount of lead time (ie: not by tomorrow!)."

"Finally, following the `ansible-devel "
"<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel>`_ mailing list "
"can be a great way to participate in the broader Ansible community, and a"

"of Ansible and its modules. If you're not on this relatively low-volume "
"list, please join us here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum"

"Issues for modules are routed to their maintainers via an automated "

"the issue creator to provide adequate details (specifically, providing "
"the proper module name) in order to route it correctly. If you are a "
"maintainer of a specific module, it is recommended that you periodically "
