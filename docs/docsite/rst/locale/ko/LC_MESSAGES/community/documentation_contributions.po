"Improving the documentation is an easy way to make your first "

"since our documentation is written in YAML (module documentation) or "
"`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (rST). If "
"you're using Ansible, you already use YAML in your playbooks. And rST is "
"mostly just text. You don't even need git experience, if you use the "
"``Edit on GitHub`` option."
