"This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful "
"variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. It can also "
"be executed directly by ``/usr/bin/ansible`` to check what variables are "
"available to a host. Ansible provides many *facts* about the system, "
"automatically."

"More ansible facts will be added with successive releases. If *facter* or"
" *ohai* are installed, variables from these programs will also be "
"snapshotted into the JSON file for usage in templating. These variables "
"are prefixed with ``facter_`` and ``ohai_`` so it's easy to tell their "
"source. All variables are bubbled up to the caller. Using the ansible "
"facts and choosing to not install *facter* and *ohai* means you can avoid"
" Ruby-dependencies on your remote systems. (See also :ref:`facter "
"<facter_module>` and :ref:`ohai <ohai_module>`.)"

"If the target host is Windows you can now use ``fact_path``. Make sure "
"that this path exists on the target host. Files in this path MUST be "
"PowerShell scripts (``*.ps1``) and their output must be formattable in "
"JSON (Ansible will take care of this). Test the output of your scripts. "
"This option was added in Ansible 2.1."
