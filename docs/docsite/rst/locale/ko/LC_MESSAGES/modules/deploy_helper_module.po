"Running it with the ``state=query`` or ``state=present`` will return the "
"``deploy_helper`` fact. ``project_path``, whatever you set in the path "
"parameter, ``current_path``, the path to the symlink that points to the "
"active release, ``releases_path``, the path to the folder to keep "
"releases in, ``shared_path``, the path to the folder to keep shared "
"resources in, ``unfinished_filename``, the file to check for to recognize"
" unfinished builds, ``previous_release``, the release the 'current' "
"symlink is pointing to, ``previous_release_path``, the full path to the "
"'current' symlink target, ``new_release``, either the 'release' parameter"
" or a generated timestamp, ``new_release_path``, the path to the new "
"release folder (not created by the module)."

"Because of the default behaviour of generating the *new_release* fact, "
"this module will not be idempotent unless you pass your own release name "
"with ``release``. Due to the nature of deploying software, this should "
"not be much of a problem."
