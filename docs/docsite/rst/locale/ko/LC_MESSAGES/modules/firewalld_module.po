"Zone transactions (creating, deleting) can be performed by using only the"
" zone and state parameters \"present\" or \"absent\". Note that zone "
"transactions must explicitly be permanent. This is a limitation in "
"firewalld. This also means that you will have to reload firewalld after "
"adding a zone that you wish to perform immediate actions on. The module "
"will not take care of this for you implicitly because that would undo any"
" previously performed immediate actions which were not permanent. "
"Therefore, if you require immediate access to a newly created zone it is "
"recommended you reload firewalld immediately after the zone creation "
"returns with a changed state and before you perform any other immediate, "
"non-permanent actions on that zone."
