msgid ""
"Since Ansible 2.0, task includes are dynamic and behave more like real "
"tasks. This means they can be looped, skipped and use variables from any "
"source. Ansible tries to auto detect this, but you can use the `static` "
"directive (which was added in Ansible 2.1) to bypass autodetection."

"Include has some unintuitive behaviours depending on if it is running in "
"a static or dynamic in play or in playbook context, in an effort to "
"clarify behaviours we are moving to a new set modules "
"(:ref:`include_tasks <include_tasks_module>`, :ref:`include_role "
"<include_role_module>`, :ref:`import_playbook <import_playbook_module>`, "
":ref:`import_tasks <import_tasks_module>`) that have well established and"
" clear behaviours. This module will still be supported for some time but "
"we are looking at deprecating it in the near future."
