"``synchronize`` is a wrapper around rsync to make common tasks in your "
"playbooks quick and easy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:20
msgid "It is run and originates on the local host where Ansible is being run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:21
msgid ""
"Of course, you could just use the ``command`` action to call rsync "
"yourself, but you also have to add a fair number of boilerplate options "
"and host facts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:22
msgid ""
"This module is not intended to provide access to the full power of rsync,"
" but does make the most common invocations easier to implement. You "
"`still` may need to call rsync directly via ``command`` or ``shell`` "
"depending on your use case."

msgid "rsync must be installed on both the local and remote host."

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:477
msgid ""
"For the ``synchronize`` module, the \"local host\" is the host `the "
"synchronize task originates on`, and the \"destination host\" is the host"
" `synchronize is connecting to`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:478
msgid ""
"The \"local host\" can be changed to a different host by using "
"`delegate_to`.  This enables copying between two remote hosts or entirely"
" on one remote machine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:479
msgid ""
"The user and permissions for the synchronize `src` are those of the user "
"running the Ansible task on the local host (or the remote_user for a "
"delegate_to host when delegate_to is used)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:481
msgid ""
"The user and permissions for the synchronize `dest` are those of the "
"`remote_user` on the destination host or the `become_user` if "
"`become=yes` is active."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:482
msgid ""
"In Ansible 2.0 a bug in the synchronize module made become occur on the "
"\"local host\".  This was fixed in Ansible 2.0.1."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:483
msgid ""
"Currently, synchronize is limited to elevating permissions via "
"passwordless sudo.  This is because rsync itself is connecting to the "
"remote machine and rsync doesn't give us a way to pass sudo credentials "
"in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:484
msgid ""
"Currently there are only a few connection types which support synchronize"
" (ssh, paramiko, local, and docker) because a sync strategy has been "
"determined for those connection types.  Note that the connection for "
"these must not need a password as rsync itself is making the connection "
"and rsync does not provide us a way to pass a password to the connection."

"To exclude files and directories from being synchronized, you may add "
"``.rsync-filter`` files to the source directory."

msgid ""
"rsync daemon must be up and running with correct permission when using "
"rsync protocol in source or destination path."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:489
msgid ""
"The ``synchronize`` module forces `--delay-updates` to avoid leaving a "
"destination in a broken in-between state if the underlying rsync process "
"encounters an error. Those synchronizing large numbers of files that are "
"willing to trade safety for performance should call rsync directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/modules/synchronize_module.rst:490
msgid ""
"link_destination is subject to the same limitations as the underlaying "
"rsync daemon. Hard links are only preserved if the relative subtrees of "
"the source and destination are the same. Attempts to hardlink into a "
"directory that is a subdirectory of the source will be prevented."
