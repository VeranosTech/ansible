"This module allows you to work with switch firmware images. It provides a"
" way to download a firmware image to a network device from a remote "
"server using FTP, SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. The first step is to create a "
"directory from where the remote server can be reached. The next step is "
"to provide the full file path of the image's location. Authentication "
"details required by the remote server must be provided as well. By "
"default, this method makes the newly downloaded firmware image the active"
" image, which will be used by the switch during the next restart. This "
"module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of "
"the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be "
"created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is "
"run."
