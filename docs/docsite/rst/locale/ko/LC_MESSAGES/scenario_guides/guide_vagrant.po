"`Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ is a tool to manage virtual "
"machine environments, and allows you to configure and use reproducible "
"work environments on top of various virtualization and cloud platforms. "
"It also has integration with Ansible as a provisioner for these virtual "
"machines, and the two tools work together well."
