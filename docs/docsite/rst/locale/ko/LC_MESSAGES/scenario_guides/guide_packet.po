"`Packet.net <https://packet.net>`_ is a bare metal infrastructure host "

"two cloud modules. The two modules are:"

#: ../../rst/scenario_guides/guide_packet.rst:10

"packet_sshkey: adds a public SSH key from file or value to the Packet "

"To use the modules and inventory script you'll need a Packet API token. "
