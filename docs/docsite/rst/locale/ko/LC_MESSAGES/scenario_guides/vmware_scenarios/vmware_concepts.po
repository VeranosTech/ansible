"Some of these concepts are common to all uses of Ansible, including "
"VMware automation; some are specific to VMware. You need to understand "
"them to use Ansible for VMware automation. This introduction provides the"
" background you need to follow the :ref:`scenarios<vmware_scenarios>` in "
"this guide."

msgid ""
"Any machine with Ansible installed. You can run commands and playbooks, "
"invoking ``/usr/bin/ansible`` or ``/usr/bin/ansible-playbook``, from any "
"control node. You can use any computer that has Python installed on it as"
" a control node - laptops, shared desktops, and servers can all run "
"Ansible. However, you cannot use a Windows machine as a control node. You"
" can have multiple control nodes."

"Delegation allows you to select the system that executes a given task. If"
" you do not have ``pyVmomi`` installed on your control node, use the "

"The units of code Ansible executes. Each module has a particular use, "
"from creating virtual machines on vCenter to managing distributed virtual"
" switches in the vCenter environment. You can invoke a single module with"
" a task, or invoke several different modules in a playbook. For an idea "
"of how many modules Ansible includes, take a look at the :ref:`list of "
"cloud modules<cloud_modules>`, which includes VMware modules."
