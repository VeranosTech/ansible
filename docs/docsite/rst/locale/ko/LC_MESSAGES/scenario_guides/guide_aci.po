"The Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Fabric includes Cisco "

"The ACI fabric provides consistent low-latency forwarding across high-"
"bandwidth links (40 Gbps, with a 100-Gbps future capability). Traffic "
"with the source and destination on the same leaf switch is handled "
"locally, and all other traffic travels from the ingress leaf to the "

"The ACI fabric object-oriented operating system (OS) runs on each Cisco "

"All the switch nodes contain a complete copy of the concrete model. When "

"sent payload is using single quotes, rather than double quotes), and as a"
