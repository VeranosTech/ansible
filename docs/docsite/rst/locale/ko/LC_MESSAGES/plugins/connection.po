"Connection plugins allow Ansible to connect to the target hosts so it can"
" execute tasks on them. Ansible ships with many connection plugins, but "
"only one can be used per host at a time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/connection.rst:12
msgid ""
"By default, Ansible ships with several plugins. The most commonly used "
"are the :ref:`paramiko SSH<paramiko_ssh_connection>`, native ssh (just "
"called :ref:`ssh<ssh_connection>`), and :ref:`local<local_connection>` "
"connection types.  All of these can be used in playbooks and with "
":command:`/usr/bin/ansible` to decide how you want to talk to remote "
"machines."

"The basics of these connection types are covered in the :ref:`getting "

"Because ssh is the default protocol used in system administration and the"

"You can extend Ansible to support other transports (such as SNMP or "

"You can set the connection plugin globally via "
":ref:`configuration<ansible_configuration_settings>`, at the command line"
" (``-c``, ``--connection``), as a :ref:`keyword <playbook_keywords>` in "
"your play, or by setting a :ref:`variable<behavioral_parameters>`, most "
"often in your inventory. For example, for Windows machines you might want"
" to set the :ref:`winrm <winrm_connection>` plugin as an inventory "
"variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/connection.rst:39

"Most connection plugins can operate with minimal configuration. By "
"default they use the :ref:`inventory "
"hostname<inventory_hostnames_lookup>` and defaults to find the target "
"host."
