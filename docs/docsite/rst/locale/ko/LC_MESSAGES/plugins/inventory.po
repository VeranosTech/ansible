"Most inventory plugins shipped with Ansible are disabled by default and "

" the default whitelist looks in the config file that ships with Ansible:"

"This list also establishes the order in which each plugin tries to parse "
"an inventory source. Any plugins left out of the list will not be "

" to what you actually use. For example:"

"The only requirement for using an inventory plugin after it is enabled is"
" to provide an inventory source to parse. Ansible will try to use the "
"list of enabled inventory plugins, in order, against each inventory "
"source provided. Once an inventory plugin succeeds at parsing a source, "
"any remaining inventory plugins will be skipped for that source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/inventory.rst:53

"To start using an inventory plugin with a YAML configuration source, "
"create a file with the accepted filename schema for the plugin in "
"question, then add ``plugin: plugin_name``. Each plugin documents any "
"naming restrictions. For example, the aws_ec2 inventory plugin has to end"
" with ``aws_ec2.(yml|yaml)``"

"You can set the default inventory path (via ``inventory`` in the "

"inventory --graph`` should yield the same output as when you passed your "

"plugins to your plugin path to use in the same way."

"Your inventory source might be a directory of inventory configuration "
"files. The constructed inventory plugin only operates on those hosts "
"already in inventory, so you may want the constructed inventory "
"configuration parsed at a particular point (such as last). Ansible parses"
" the directory recursively, alphabetically. You cannot configure the "
"parsing approach, so name your files to make it work predictably. "
"Inventory plugins that extend constructed features directly can work "
"around that restriction by adding constructed options in addition to the "
"inventory plugin options. Otherwise, you can use ``-i`` with multiple "
"sources to impose a specific order, e.g. ``-i demo.aws_ec2.yml -i "
"clouds.yml -i constructed.yml``."

"You can create dynamic groups using host variables with the constructed "
