"Lookup plugins allow Ansible to access data from outside sources. This "
"can include reading the filesystem in addition to contacting external "
"datastores and services. Like all templating, these plugins are evaluated"
" on the Ansible control machine, not on the target/remote."

"The data returned by a lookup plugin is made available using the standard"
" templating system in Ansible, and are typically used to load variables "

"Lookups are an integral part of loops. Wherever you see ``with_``, the "
"part after the underscore is the name of a lookup. This is also the "

"``with_items`` uses the :ref:`items <items_lookup>` lookup:"

"In Ansible 2.5, a new jinja2 function called ``query`` was added for "
"invoking lookup plugins. The difference between ``lookup`` and ``query`` "
"is largely that ``query`` will always return a list. The default behavior"
" of ``lookup`` is to return a string of comma separated values. "
"``lookup`` can be explicitly configured to return a list using "
"``wantlist=True``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/lookup.rst:121

"This was done primarily to provide an easier and more consistent "
