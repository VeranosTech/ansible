"Callback plugins enable adding new behaviors to Ansible when responding "
"to events. By default, callback plugins control most of the output you "
"see when running the command line programs, but can also be used to add "
"additional output, integrate with other tools and marshall the events to "
"a storage backend."

"You can activate a custom callback by either dropping it into a "
