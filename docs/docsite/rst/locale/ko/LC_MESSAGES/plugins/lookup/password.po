"A special case is using /dev/null as a path. The password lookup will "
"generate a new random password each time, but will not write it to "
"/dev/null. This can be used when you need a password without storing it "
"on the controller."

"A great alternative to the password lookup plugin, if you don't need to "
"generate random passwords on a per-host basis, would be to use Vault in "
"playbooks. Read the documentation there and consider using it first, it "
"will be more desirable for most applications."

"If the file already exists, no data will be written to it. If the file "
"has contents, those contents will be read in as the password. Empty files"
" cause the password to return as an empty string."

"As all lookups, this runs on the Ansible host as the user running the "
"playbook, and \"become\" does not apply, the target file must be readable"
" by the playbook user, or, if it does not exist, the playbook user must "
"have sufficient privileges to create it. (So, for example, attempts to "
"write into areas such as /etc will fail unless the entire playbook is "
"being run as root)."
