msgid ""
"The dig lookup runs queries against DNS servers to retrieve DNS records "
"for a specific name (FQDN - fully qualified domain name). It is possible "
"to lookup any DNS record in this manner."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/lookup/dig.rst:19
msgid ""
"There is a couple of different syntaxes that can be used to specify what "
"record should be retrieved, and for which name. It is also possible to "
"explicitly specify the DNS server(s) to use for lookups."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/lookup/dig.rst:20
msgid ""
"In its simplest form, the dig lookup plugin can be used to retrieve an "
"IPv4 address (DNS A record) associated with FQDN"
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/lookup/dig.rst:21
msgid ""
"In addition to (default) A record, it is also possible to specify a "
"different record type that should be queried. This can be done by either "
"passing-in additional parameter of format qtype=TYPE to the dig lookup, "
"or by appending /TYPE to the FQDN being queried."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/lookup/dig.rst:22
msgid ""
"If multiple values are associated with the requested record, the results "
"will be returned as a comma-separated list. In such cases you may want to"
" pass option wantlist=True to the plugin, which will result in the record"
" values being returned as a list over which you can iterate later on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/lookup/dig.rst:23
msgid ""
"By default, the lookup will rely on system-wide configured DNS servers "
"for performing the query. It is also possible to explicitly specify DNS "
"servers to query using the @DNS_SERVER_1,DNS_SERVER_2,...,DNS_SERVER_N "
"notation. This needs to be passed-in as an additional parameter to the "
"lookup"
