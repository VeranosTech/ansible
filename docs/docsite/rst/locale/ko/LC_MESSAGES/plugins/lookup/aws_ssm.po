"Get the value for an Amazon Simple Systems Manager parameter or a "
"hierarchy of parameters. The first argument you pass the lookup can "
"either be a parameter name or a hierarchy of parameters. Hierarchies "
"start with a forward slash and end with the parameter name. Up to 5 "
"layers may be specified."

"If looking up an explicitly listed parameter by name which does not exist"
" then the lookup will return a None value which will be interpreted by "
"Jinja2 as an empty string.  You can use the ```default``` filter to give "
"a default value in this case but must set the second parameter to true "
"(see examples below)"

"When looking up a path for parameters under it a dictionary will be "
"returned for each path. If there is no parameter under that path then the"
" return will be successful but the dictionary will be empty."

msgid ""
"If the lookup fails due to lack of permissions or due to an AWS client "
"error then the aws_ssm will generate an error, normally crashing the "
"current ansible task.  This is normally the right thing since ignoring a "
"value that IAM isn't giving access to could cause bigger problems and "
"wrong behaviour or loss of data.  If you want to continue in this case "
"then you will have to set up two ansible tasks, one which sets a variable"
" and ignores failures one which uses the value of that variable with a "
"default.  See the examples below."
