"INI file based inventory, sections are groups or group related with "

"When declared inline with the host, INI values are are processed by "
"Python's ast.literal_eval function "
"(https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval) and "
"interpreted as Python literal structures (strings, numbers, tuples, "
"lists, dicts, booleans, None). Host lines accept multiple ``key=value`` "
"parameters per line. Therefore they need a way to indicate that a space "
"is part of a value rather than a separator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/plugins/inventory/ini.rst:27
msgid ""
"When declared in a ``:vars`` section, INI values are interpreted as "
"strings. For example ``var=FALSE`` would create a string equal to "
"``FALSE``. Unlike host lines, ``:vars`` sections accept only a single "
"entry per line, so everything after the ``=`` must be the value for the "
"entry."
