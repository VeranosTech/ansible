"Task execution is as fast as possible per host in batch as defined by "
"``serial`` (default all). Ansible will not start a play for a host unless"
" the play can be finished without interruption by tasks for another host,"
" i.e. the number of hosts with an active play does not exceed the number "
"of forks. Ansible will not wait for other hosts to finish the current "
"task before queuing the next task for a host that has finished. Once a "
"host is done with the play, it opens it's slot to a new host that was "
"waiting to start. Other than that, it behaves just like the \"free\" "
"strategy."
