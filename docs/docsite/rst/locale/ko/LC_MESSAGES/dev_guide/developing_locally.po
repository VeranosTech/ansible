"The easiest, quickest, and most popular way to extend Ansible is to copy "
"or write a module or a plugin for local use. You can store local modules "
"and plugins on your Ansible control node for use within your team or "
"organization. You can also share a local plugin or module by embedding it"
" in a role and publishing it on Ansible Galaxy. If you've been using "
"roles off Galaxy, you may have been using local modules and plugins "
"without even realizing it. If you're using a local module or plugin that "
"already exists, this page is all you need."

"Modules are reusable, standalone scripts that can be used by the Ansible "
"API, the :command:`ansible` command, or the :command:`ansible-playbook` "
"command. Modules provide a defined interface, accepting arguments and "
"returning information to Ansible by printing a JSON string to stdout "
"before exiting."
