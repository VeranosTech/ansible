"A module is a reusable, standalone script that Ansible runs on your "
"behalf, either locally or remotely. Modules interact with your local "
"machine, an API, or a remote system to perform specific tasks like "
"changing a database password or spinning up a cloud instance. Each module"
" can be used by the Ansible API, or by the :command:`ansible` or :command"
":`ansible-playbook` programs. A module provides a defined interface, "
"accepting arguments and returning information to Ansible by printing a "
"JSON string to stdout before exiting. Ansible ships with thousands of "
"modules, and you can easily write your own. If you're writing a module "
"for local use, you can choose any programming language and follow your "
"own rules. This tutorial illustrates how to get started developing an "
"Ansible module in Python."
