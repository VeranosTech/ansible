"Modules should typically encompass much of the logic for interacting with"
" a resource. A lightweight wrapper around an API that does not contain "
"much logic would likely cause users to offload too much logic into a "
"playbook, and for this reason the module would be rejected. Instead try "
"creating multiple modules for interacting with smaller individual pieces "
"of the API."
