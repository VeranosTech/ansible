"The essence of the Ansible writing style is short sentences that flow "
"naturally together. Mix up sentence structures. Vary sentence subjects. "
"Address the reader directly. Ask a question. And when the reader adjusts "
"to the pace of shorter sentences, write a longer one."

"Use the active voice (\"Start Linuxconf by typing...\") rather than "
"passive (\"Linuxconf can be started by typing...\") whenever possible. "
"Active voice makes for more lively, interesting reading. Also avoid "
"future tense (or using the term \"will\") whenever possible For example, "
"future tense (\"The screen will display...\") does not read as well as an"
" active voice (\"The screen displays\"). Remember, the users you are "
"writing for most often refer to the documentation while they are using "
"the system, not after or in advance of using the system."
