msgid ""
"Before a trademark is registered with the United States Patent and "
"Trademark Office it is appropriate to use the TM or SM symbol depending "
"whether the product is for goods or services. It is important to use the "
"TM or SM as it is notification to the public that Ansible claims rights "
"to the mark even though it has not yet been registered."

#: ../../rst/dev_guide/style_guide/trademarks.rst:8
msgid ""
"Once the trademark is registered, it is appropriate to use the symbol in "
"place of the TM or SM. The symbol designation must be used in conjunction"
" with the trademark if Ansible is to fully protect its rights. If we "
"don't protect these marks, we run the risk of losing them in the way of "
"Aspirin or Trampoline or Escalator."
