"If you want to contribute your module to Ansible, you must write your "

"following this format, you should review our :ref:`submission checklist "

"Keen Python programmers may notice that contrary to PEP 8's advice we "
"don't put ``imports`` at the top of the file. This is because the "
"``ANSIBLE_METADATA`` through ``RETURN`` sections are not used by the "
"module code itself; they are essentially extra docstrings for the file. "
"The imports are placed after these special variables for the same reason "
"as PEP 8 puts the imports after the introductory comments and docstrings."
" This keeps the active parts of the code together and the pieces which "
"are purely informational apart. The decision to exclude E402 is based on "
"readability (which is what PEP 8 is about). Documentation strings in a "
"module are much more similar to module level docstrings, than code, and "
"are never utilized by the module itself. Placing the imports below this "
"documentation and closer to the code, consolidates and groups all related"
" code in a congruent manner to improve readability, debugging and "
"understanding."
