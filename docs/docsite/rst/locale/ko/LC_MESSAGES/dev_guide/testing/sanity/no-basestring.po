"Do not use ``isinstance(s, basestring)`` as basestring has been removed "
"in Python3.  You can import ``string_types``, ``binary_type``, or "
"``text_type`` from ``ansible.module_utils.six`` and then use "
"``isinstance(s, string_types)`` or ``isinstance(s, (binary_type, "
"text_type))`` instead."

"If this is part of code to convert a string to a particular type, "
"``ansible.module_utils._text`` contains several functions that may be "
"even better for you: ``to_text``, ``to_bytes``, and ``to_native``."
