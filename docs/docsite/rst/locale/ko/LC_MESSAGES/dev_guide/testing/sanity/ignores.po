"When code is fixed to resolve sanity test errors, any relevant ignores "

"If a sanity test results in a traceback when processing content, that "

"Caution should be used when skipping sanity tests instead of ignoring "
"them. Since the test is skipped entirely, resolution of the issue will "
"not be automatically detected. This will prevent prevent regression "
"detection from working once the issue has been resolved. For this reason "
"it is a good idea to periodically review skipped entries manually to "
