"Instead of using ``assert`` you should utilize simple ``if`` statements, "
"that result in raising an exception. There is a new exception called "
"``AnsibleAssertionError`` that inherits from ``AnsibleError`` and "
"``AssertionError``. When possible, utilize a more specific exception than"
" ``AnsibleAssertionError``."

"Modules will not have access to ``AnsibleAssertionError`` and should "
"instead raise ``AssertionError``, a more specific exception, or just use "
