"Instead of using ``assert`` you should utilize simple ``if`` statements, "
"that result in raising an exception. There is a new exception called "
"``AnsibleAssertionError`` that inherits from ``AnsibleError`` and "
"``AssertionError``. When possible, utilize a more specific exception than"
" ``AnsibleAssertionError``."
