"As described in :ref:`dynamic_inventory`, Ansible can pull inventory "
"information from dynamic sources, including cloud sources, using the "
"supplied :ref:`inventory plugins <inventory_plugins>`. If the source you "

"In previous versions you had to create a script or program that can "
"output JSON in the correct format when invoked with the proper arguments."
" You can still use and write inventory scripts, as we ensured backwards "
"compatibility via the :ref:`script inventory plugin <script_inventory>` "
"and there is no restriction on the programming language used. If you "
"choose to write a script, however, you will need to implement some "
"features yourself. i.e caching, configuration management, dynamic "
"variable and group composition, etc. While with :ref:`inventory plugins "
"<inventory_plugins>` you can leverage the Ansible codebase to add these "
"common features."
