"In this use case / example, we will be selecting a virtual machine "

"Since Ansible utilizes the VMware API to perform actions, in this use "
"case we will be connecting directly to the API from our localhost. This "
"means that our playbooks will not be running from the vCenter or ESXi "
"Server. We do not necessarily need to collect facts about our localhost, "
"so the ``gather_facts`` parameter will be disabled. You can run these "
"modules against another server that would then connect to the API if your"
" localhost does not have access to vCenter. If so, the required Python "
"modules will need to be installed on that target server."

"To begin, there are a few bits of information we will need. First and "
"foremost is the hostname of the ESXi server or vCenter server. After "
"this, you will need the username and password for this server. For now, "
"you will be entering these directly, but in a more advanced playbook this"
" can be abstracted out and stored in a more secure fashion using  :ref"
":`ansible-vault` or using `Ansible Tower credentials "
"<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-"
"tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html>`_. If your vCenter or ESXi "
"server is not setup with proper CA certificates that can be verified from"
" the Ansible server, then it is necessary to disable validation of these "
"certificates by using the ``validate_certs`` parameter. To do this you "
"need to set ``validate_certs=False`` in your playbook."

"Now you need to supply the information about the virtual machine which "
"will be created. Give your virtual machine a name, one that conforms to "
"all VMware requirements for naming conventions.  Next, select the display"
" name of the template from which you want to clone new virtual machine. "
"This must match what's displayed in VMware Web UI exactly. Then you can "
"specify a folder to place this new virtual machine in. This path can "
"either be a relative path or a full path to the folder including the "
"Datacenter. You may need to specify a state for the virtual machine.  "
"This simply tells the module which action you want to take, in this case "
"you will be ensure that the virtual machine exists and is powered on.  An"
" optional parameter is ``wait_for_ip_address``, this will tell Ansible to"
" wait for the virtual machine to fully boot up and VMware Tools is "
"running before completing this task."
