"These concepts are common to all uses of Ansible, including VMware "
"automation. You need to understand them to use Ansible for VMware "
"automation. This basic introduction provides the background you need to "
"follow the examples in this guide."

msgid ""
"Any machine with Ansible installed. You can run commands and playbooks, "
"invoking ``/usr/bin/ansible`` or ``/usr/bin/ansible-playbook``, from any "
"control node. You can use any computer that has Python installed on it as"
" a control node - laptops, shared desktops, and servers can all run "
"Ansible. However, you cannot use a Windows machine as a control node. You"
" can have multiple control nodes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/vmware/vmware_concepts.rst:19
msgid ""
"If you want to perform a VMware specific task on one host with reference "
"to ESXi server or vCenter server, use the ``delegate_to`` keyword on a "
"task. This delegation host will be any host where you have ``pyVmomi`` "
"installed. Your control node and ``delegate_to`` host can be same or "
"different."

msgid ""
"The units of code Ansible executes. Each module has a particular use, "
"from creating virtual machines on vCenter to managing distributed virtual"
" switches on vCenter environment. You can invoke a single module with a "
"task, or invoke several different modules in a playbook. For an idea of "
"how many modules Ansible includes, take a look at the :ref:`list of "
"VMware modules<vmware_cloud_modules>`."

#: ../../rst/vmware/vmware_concepts.rst:30
msgid ""
"Ordered lists of tasks, saved so you can run those tasks in that order "
"repeatedly. Playbooks can include variables as well as tasks. Playbooks "

"Ansible VMware modules are written on top of `pyVmomi "
"<https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi>`_. ``pyVmomi`` is the official Python"

" vCenter infrastructure."
