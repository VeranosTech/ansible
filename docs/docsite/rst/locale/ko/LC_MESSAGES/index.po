"Ansible is an IT automation tool.  It can configure systems, deploy "
"software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous "
"deployments or zero downtime rolling updates."

"Ansible은 IT 자동화 도구이다. 시스템을 설정하고 소프트웨어를 설치하며"
"지속적 배포(Continuous Deployment) 혹은 무정지 업데이트(Zero-Downtime Rolling Update) 등의"
"복잡한 IT 업무를 자동화할 수 있다."

"Ansible's main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use. It also has a strong"
" focus on security and reliability, featuring a minimum of moving parts, "
"usage of OpenSSH for transport (with other transports and pull modes as "
"alternatives), and a language that is designed around auditability by "
"humans--even those not familiar with the program."

"Ansible의 주목표는 단순함과 쉬운 사용이다."

"We believe simplicity is relevant to all sizes of environments, so we "
"design for busy users of all types: developers, sysadmins, release "
"engineers, IT managers, and everyone in between. Ansible is appropriate "
"for managing all environments, from small setups with a handful of "
"instances to enterprise environments with many thousands of instances."

"Ansible manages machines in an agent-less manner. There is never a "
"question of how to upgrade remote daemons or the problem of not being "
"able to manage systems because daemons are uninstalled.  Because OpenSSH "
"is one of the most peer-reviewed open source components, security "
"exposure is greatly reduced. Ansible is decentralized--it relies on your "
"existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines. If needed, "
"Ansible can easily connect with Kerberos, LDAP, and other centralized "
"authentication management systems."

"corner of this page. We maintain multiple versions of Ansible and of the "
"documentation, so please be sure you are using the version of the "
"documentation that covers the version of Ansible you're using. For recent"
" features, we note the version of Ansible where the feature was added."

"Ansible releases a new major release of Ansible approximately three to "
"four times per year. The core application evolves somewhat "
"conservatively, valuing simplicity in language design and setup. However,"
" the community around new modules and plugins being developed and "
"contributed moves very quickly, adding many new modules in each release."
