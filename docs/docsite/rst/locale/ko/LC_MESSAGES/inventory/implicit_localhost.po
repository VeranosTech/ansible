"This ensures that the proper connection and Python are used to execute "

"creating a ``localhost`` host entry in your inventory. At that point, all"
" implicit behaviors are ignored; the ``localhost`` in inventory is "
"treated just like any other host. Group and host vars will apply, "
"including connection vars, which includes the "
"``ansible_python_interpreter`` setting. This will also affect "
"``delegate_to: localhost`` and ``local_action``, the latter being an "
"alias to the former."
