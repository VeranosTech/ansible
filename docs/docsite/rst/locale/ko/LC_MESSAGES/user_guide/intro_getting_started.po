"What we are showing first are not the powerful "
"configuration/deployment/orchestration features of Ansible. These "
"features are handled by playbooks which are covered in a separate "
"section."

"This section is about how to initially get Ansible running.  Once you "
"understand these concepts, read :doc:`intro_adhoc` for some more detail, "

msgid ""
"Before we get started, it's important to understand how Ansible "
"communicates with remote machines over the `SSH protocol "
"<https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/intro_getting_started.rst:29
msgid ""
"By default, Ansible will try to use native OpenSSH for remote "
"communication when possible.  This enables ControlPersist (a performance "
"feature), Kerberos, and options in ``~/.ssh/config`` such as Jump Host "
"setup.  However, when using Enterprise Linux 6 operating systems as the "
"control machine (Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as "
"CentOS), the version of OpenSSH may be too old to support ControlPersist."
" On these operating systems, Ansible will fallback into using a high-"
"quality Python implementation of OpenSSH called 'paramiko'.  If you wish "
"to use features like Kerberized SSH and more, consider using Fedora, "
"macOS, or Ubuntu as your control machine until a newer version of OpenSSH"
" is available for your platform."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/intro_getting_started.rst:33
msgid ""
"Occasionally you'll encounter a device that doesn't support SFTP. This is"
" rare, but should it occur, you can switch to SCP mode in "
":ref:`intro_configuration`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/intro_getting_started.rst:35
msgid ""
"When speaking with remote machines, Ansible by default assumes you are "
"using SSH keys.  SSH keys are encouraged but password authentication can "
"also be used where needed by supplying the option ``--ask-pass``.  If "
"using sudo features and when sudo requires a password, also supply "
"``--ask-become-pass`` (previously ``--ask-sudo-pass`` which has been "
"deprecated)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/shared_snippets/SSH_password_prompt.txt:2
msgid ""
"Ansible does not expose a channel to allow communication between the user"
" and the ssh process to accept a password manually to decrypt an ssh key "
"when using the ssh connection plugin (which is the default). The use of "
"``ssh-agent`` is highly recommended."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/intro_getting_started.rst:39
msgid ""
"While it may be common sense, it is worth sharing: Any management system "
"benefits from being run near the machines being managed. If you are "
"running Ansible in a cloud, consider running it from a machine inside "
"that cloud.  In most cases this will work better than on the open "
"Internet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/intro_getting_started.rst:41
msgid ""
"As an advanced topic, Ansible doesn't just have to connect remotely over "
"SSH.  The transports are pluggable, and there are options for managing "
"things locally, as well as managing chroot, lxc, and jail containers.  A "
"mode called 'ansible-pull' can also invert the system and have systems "
"'phone home' via scheduled git checkouts to pull configuration directives"
" from a central repository."

":doc:`intro_adhoc`, explore what you can do with different modules, and "
"to learn about the Ansible :doc:`playbooks` language.  Ansible is not "

"If a host is reinstalled and has a different key in 'known_hosts', this "

"To enable basic logging on the control machine see "
