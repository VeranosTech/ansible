"Jinja2 templates leverage Python data types and standard functions.  This"
" makes for a rich set of operations that can be performed on data.  "
"However, this also means that certain specifics of the underlying Python "
"becomes visible to template authors.  Since Ansible playbooks use Jinja2 "
"for templates and variables, this means that playbook authors need to be "
"aware of these specifics as well."

"Unless otherwise noted, these differences are only of interest when "
"running Ansible in Python2 versus Python3.  Changes within Python2 and "
"Python3 are generally small enough that they are not visible at the "

"In Python2, the :meth:`dict.keys`, :meth:`dict.values`, and "
":meth:`dict.items` methods returns a list.  Jinja2 returns that to "
"Ansible via a string representation that Ansible can turn back into a "
"list.  In Python3, those methods return a :ref:`dictionary view <python3"
":dict-views>` object.  The string representation that Jinja2 returns for "
"dictionary views cannot be parsed back into a list by Ansible.  It is, "
"however, easy to make this portable by using the :func:`list "
"<jinja2:list>` filter whenever using :meth:`dict.keys`, "
":meth:`dict.values`, or :meth:`dict.items`::"
