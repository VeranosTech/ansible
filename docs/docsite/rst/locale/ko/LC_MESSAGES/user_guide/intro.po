"Before we start exploring the main components of Ansible -- playbooks, "
"configuration management, deployment, and orchestration -- we'll learn "
"how to get Ansible installed and cover some basic concepts.  We'll also "

"using /usr/bin/ansible, and see what modules are available in Ansible's "
"core (you can also write your own, which is covered later)."
