"Often the result of a play may depend on the value of a variable, fact "
"(something learned about the remote system), or previous task result. In "

"Additional groups can be created to manage hosts based on whether the "
"hosts match other criteria. This topic covers how conditionals are used "
"in playbooks."

"How does this work?  For Red Hat operating systems ('CentOS', for "
