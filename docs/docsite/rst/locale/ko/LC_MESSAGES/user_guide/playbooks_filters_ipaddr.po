"``ipaddr()`` is a Jinja2 filter designed to provide an interface to the "
"`netaddr`_ Python package from within Ansible. It can operate on strings "
"or lists of items, test various data to check if they are valid IP "
"addresses, and manipulate the input data to extract requested "
"information. ``ipaddr()`` works with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in "
"various forms. There are also additional functions available to "
"manipulate IP subnets and MAC addresses."

"To use this filter in Ansible, you need to install the `netaddr`_ Python "
"library on a computer on which you use Ansible (it is not required on "
"remote hosts). It can usually be installed with either your system "
