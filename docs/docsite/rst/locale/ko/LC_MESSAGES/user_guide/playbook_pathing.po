"By default these should be relative to the config file, some are "
"specifically relative to the 'cwd' or the playbook and should have this "
"noted in their description. Things like ssh keys are left to use 'cwd' "

"Here things start getting complicated, there are 2 different scopes to "
"consider, task evaluation (paths are all local, like in lookups) and task"
" execution, which is normally on the remote, unless an action plugin is "
"involved."

"Some tasks that require 'local' resources use action plugins (template "

"Lookups and action plugins both use a special 'search magic' to find "
"things, taking the current play into account, it uses from most specific "
"to most general playbook dir in which a task is contained (this includes "
"roles and includes)."

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbook_pathing.rst:27
msgid ""
"Using this magic, relative paths get attempted first with a "
"'files|templates|vars' appended (if not already present), depending on "
"action being taken, 'files' is the default. (i.e include_vars will use "
"vars/).  The paths will be searched from most specific to most general "
"(i.e role before play). dependent roles WILL be traversed (i.e task is in"
" role2, role2 is a dependency of role1, role2 will be looked at first, "
"then role1, then play). i.e ::"

"The current working directory (cwd) is not searched. If you see it, it "
"just happens to coincide with one of the paths above. If you `include` a "
"task file from a role, it  will NOT trigger role behavior, this only "
"happens when running as a role, `include_role` will work. A new variable "
"`ansible_search_path` var will have the search path used, in order (but "
"without the appended subdirs). Using 5 \"v\"s (`-vvvvv`) should show the "
"detail of the search as it happens."
