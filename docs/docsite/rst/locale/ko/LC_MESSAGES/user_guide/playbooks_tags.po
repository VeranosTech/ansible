"If you have a large playbook, it may become useful to be able to run only"
" a specific part of it rather than running *everything* in the playbook. "

"Tags can be applied to *many* structures in Ansible (see \"tag "
"inheritance\", below), but its simplest use is with individual tasks. "
"Here is an example that tags two tasks with different tags::"

"For example, if you wanted to just run the \"configuration\" and "

"On the other hand, if you want to run a playbook *without* certain tagged"

msgid "Tag Inheritance"
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:91
msgid ""
"Adding ``tags:`` to a play, or to statically imported tasks and roles, "
"adds those tags to all of the contained tasks. This is referred to as "
"*tag inheritance*. Tag inheritance is *not* applicable to dynamic "
"inclusions such as ``include_role`` and ``include_tasks``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:96
msgid ""
"When you apply ``tags:`` attributes to structures other than tasks, "
"Ansible processes the tag attribute to apply ONLY to the tasks they "
"contain. Applying tags anywhere other than tasks is just a convenience so"
" you don't have to tag tasks individually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:101

"All of these apply the specified tags to EACH task inside the play, "

msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:137
msgid ""
"Tags are applied *down* the dependency chain. In order for a tag to be "
"inherited to a dependent role's tasks, the tag should be applied to the "
"role declaration or static import, not to all the tasks within the role."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:141

"There is no way to 'import only these tags'; you probably want to split "

"The above information does not apply to `include_tasks` or other dynamic "
