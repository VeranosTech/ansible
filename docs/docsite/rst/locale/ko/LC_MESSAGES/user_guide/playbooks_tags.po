"Tags can be applied to *many* structures in Ansible (see \"tag "

msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:81
msgid ""
"Adding ``tags:`` to a play, or to statically imported tasks and roles, "
"adds those tags to all of the contained tasks. This is referred to as "
"*tag inheritance*. Tag inheritance is *not* applicable to dynamic "
"inclusions such as ``include_role`` and ``include_tasks``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:86
msgid ""
"When you apply ``tags:`` attributes to structures other than tasks, "
"Ansible processes the tag attribute to apply ONLY to the tasks they "

" you don't have to tag tasks individually."

msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tags.rst:127
msgid ""
"Tags are applied *down* the dependency chain. In order for a tag to be "

"There is no way to 'import only these tags'; you probably want to split "

"The above information does not apply to `include_tasks` or other dynamic "

"To use tags with tasks and roles intended for dynamic inclusions, all "
