"By default tasks in playbooks block, meaning the connections stay open "
"until the task is done on each node.  This may not always be desirable, "
"or you may be running operations that take longer than the SSH timeout."

"To avoid blocking or timeout issues, you can use asynchronous mode to run"
" all of your tasks at once and then poll until they are done."

"To launch a task asynchronously, specify its maximum runtime and how "
"frequently you would like to poll for status.  The default poll value is "
"10 seconds if you do not specify a value for `poll`::"

"There is no default for the async time limit.  If you leave off the "
"'async' keyword, the task runs synchronously, which is Ansible's default."

"As of Ansible 2.3, async does not support check mode and will fail the "
"task when run in check mode. See :doc:`playbooks_checkmode` on how to "
"skip a task in check mode."

"Alternatively, if you do not need to wait on the task to complete, you "
"may run the task asynchronously by specifying a poll value of 0::"

"You shouldn't attempt run a task asynchronously by specifying a poll "
"value of 0:: to with operations that require exclusive locks (such as yum"
" transactions) if you expect to run other commands later in the playbook "
"against those same resources."

"Using a higher value for ``--forks`` will result in kicking off "
"asynchronous tasks even faster.  This also increases the efficiency of "

"If the value of ``async:`` is not high enough, this will cause the "
