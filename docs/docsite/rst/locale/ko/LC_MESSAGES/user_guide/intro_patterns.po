"Patterns in Ansible are how we decide which hosts to manage.  This can "
"mean what hosts to communicate with, but in terms of :doc:`playbooks` it "
"actually means what hosts to apply a particular configuration or IT "
"process to."

"Anyway, to use Ansible, you'll first need to know how to tell Ansible "
