"Sometimes a command that returns different than 0 isn't an error.  "

"write a task that looks like this::"

"Note that the above system only governs the return value of failure of "
"the particular task, so if you have an undefined variable used or a "
"syntax error, it will still raise an error that users will need to "
"address. Note that this will not prevent failures on connection or "
"execution issues. This feature only works when the task must be able to "
"run and return a value of 'failed'."

"Connection failures set hosts as 'UNREACHABLE', which will remove them "

"When a task fails on a host, handlers which were previously notified will"
" *not* be run on that host. This can lead to cases where an unrelated "
"failure can leave a host in an unexpected state. For example, a task "
"could update a configuration file and notify a handler to restart some "
"service. If a task later on in the same play fails, the service will not "
"be restarted despite the configuration change."

"You can change this behavior with the ``--force-handlers`` command-line "
"option, or by including ``force_handlers: True`` in a play, or "
"``force_handlers = True`` in ansible.cfg. When handlers are forced, they "
"will run when notified even if a task fails on that host. (Note that "
"certain errors could still prevent the handler from running, such as a "
"host becoming unreachable.)"
