"Being designed for multi-tier deployments since the beginning, Ansible is"
" great at doing things on one host on behalf of another, or doing local "
"steps with reference to some remote hosts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:10
msgid ""
"This in particular is very applicable when setting up continuous "
"deployment infrastructure or zero downtime rolling updates, where you "
"might be talking with load balancers or monitoring systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:12
msgid ""
"Additional features allow for tuning the orders in which things complete,"
" and assigning a batch window size for how many machines to process at "
"once during a rolling update."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:14
msgid ""
"This section covers all of these features.  For examples of these items "
"in use, `please see the ansible-examples repository "
"<https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples/>`_. There are quite a few "
"examples of zero-downtime update procedures for different kinds of "
"applications."

"You should also consult the :doc:`modules` section, various modules like "
"'ec2_elb', 'nagios', and 'bigip_pool', and 'netscaler' dovetail neatly "
"with the concepts mentioned here."

"You'll also want to read up on :doc:`playbooks_reuse_roles`, as the "

"Be aware that certain tasks are impossible to delegate, i.e. `include`, "

"By default, Ansible will try to manage all of the machines referenced in "
"a play in parallel.  For a rolling update use case, you can define how "
"many hosts Ansible should manage at a single time by using the ``serial``"
" keyword::"
msgstr ""

"The ``serial`` keyword can also be specified as a percentage, which will "

"the number of hosts per pass::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:79
msgid ""
"If the number of hosts does not divide equally into the number of passes,"
" the final pass will contain the remainder."

"As of Ansible 2.2, the batch sizes can be specified as a list, as "
"follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:90
msgid ""
"In the above example, the first batch would contain a single host, the "
"next would contain 5 hosts, and (if there are any hosts left), every "
"following batch would contain 10 hosts until all available hosts are "

msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:120
msgid ""
"By default, Ansible will continue executing actions as long as there are "
"hosts in the batch that have not yet failed. The batch size for a play is"
" determined by the ``serial`` parameter. If ``serial`` is not set, then "
"batch size is all the hosts specified in the ``hosts:`` field. In some "
"situations, such as with the rolling updates described above, it may be "
"desirable to abort the play when a certain threshold of failures have "
"been reached. To achieve this, you can set a maximum failure percentage "
"on a play as follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:129

"In the above example, if more than 3 of the 10 servers in the group were "

msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:133
msgid ""
"The percentage set must be exceeded, not equaled. For example, if serial "

"If you want to perform a task on one host with reference to other hosts, "
"use the 'delegate_to' keyword on a task. This is ideal for placing nodes "
"in a load balanced pool, or removing them.  It is also very useful for "
"controlling outage windows. Be aware that it does not make sense to "
"delegate all tasks, debug, add_host, include, etc always get executed on "
"the controller. Using this with the 'serial' keyword to control the "
"number of hosts executing at one time is also a good idea::"

"These commands will run on 127.0.0.1, which is the machine running "

msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.rst:256
msgid ""
"This directive forces the task to attempt execution on the first host in "
