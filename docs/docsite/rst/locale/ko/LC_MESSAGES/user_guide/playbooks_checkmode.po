"When ansible-playbook is executed with ``--check`` it will not make any "
"changes on remote systems.  Instead, any module instrumented to support "
"'check mode' (which contains most of the primary core modules, but it is "
"not required that all modules do this) will report what changes they "
"would have made rather than making them.  Other modules that do not "
"support check mode will also take no action, but just will not report "
"what changes they might have made."

"Check mode is just a simulation, and if you have steps that use "
"conditionals that depend on the results of prior commands, it may be less"
" useful for you.  However it is great for one-node-at-time basic "
"configuration management use cases."

"The ``--diff`` option to ansible-playbook works great with ``--check`` "
"(detailed above) but can also be used by itself. When this flag is "
"supplied and the module supports this, Ansible will report back the "
"changes made or, if used with ``--check``, the changes that would have "
"been made. This is mostly used in modules that manipulate files (i.e. "
"template) but other modules might also show 'before and after' "
"information (i.e. user). Since the diff feature produces a large amount "
"of output, it is best used when checking a single host at a time. For "
