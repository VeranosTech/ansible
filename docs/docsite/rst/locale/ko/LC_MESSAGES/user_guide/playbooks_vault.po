"The \"Vault\" is a feature of Ansible that allows you to keep sensitive "
"data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than as "
"plaintext in playbooks or roles. These vault files can then be "
"distributed or placed in source control."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_vault.rst:10
msgid ""
"To enable this feature, a command line tool, :ref:`ansible-vault` is used"
" to edit files, and a command line flag :option:`--ask-vault-pass "
"<ansible-vault --ask-vault-pass>` or :option:`--vault-password-file "
"<ansible-vault --vault-password-file>` is used. You can also modify your "
"``ansible.cfg`` file to specify the location of a password file or "
"configure Ansible to always prompt for the password. These options "
"require no command line flag usage."

"This prompt will then be used to decrypt (in memory only) any vault "
"encrypted files that are accessed.  Currently this requires that all "

"Alternatively, passwords can be specified with a file or a script (the "
"script version will require Ansible 1.7 or later).  When using this flag,"
" ensure permissions on the file are such that no one else can access your"
" key and do not add your key to source control::"

"You can also set :envvar:`ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` environment "
"variable, e.g. ``ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/.vault_pass.txt`` and "

"If you are using a script instead of a flat file, ensure that it is "
"marked as executable, and that the password is printed to standard "

"The :option:`--vault-password-file <ansible-pull --vault-password-file>` "

"This vaulted variable will be decrypted with the supplied vault secret "

"used from your favorite editor to create these vaulted variables; you "
"just have to be sure to add the ``!vault`` tag so both Ansible and YAML "
