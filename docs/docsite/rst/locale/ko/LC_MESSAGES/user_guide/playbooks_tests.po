"`Tests <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#tests>`_ in Jinja are "
"a way of evaluating template expressions and returning True or False. "
"Jinja ships with many of these. See `builtin tests`_ in the official "
"Jinja template documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_tests.rst:12
msgid ""
"The main difference between tests and filters are that Jinja tests are "
"used for comparisons, whereas filters are used for data manipulation, and"
" have different applications in jinja. Tests can also be used in list "
"processing filters, like ``map()`` and ``select()`` to choose items in "
"the list."

"Like all templating, tests always execute on the Ansible controller, "

"`Test syntax <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#tests>`_ varies "
"from `filter syntax "
"<http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#filters>`_ (``variable | "
"filter``). Historically Ansible has registered tests as both jinja tests "
"and jinja filters, allowing for them to be referenced using filter "
"syntax."

"'match' requires zero or more characters at the beginning of the string, "
