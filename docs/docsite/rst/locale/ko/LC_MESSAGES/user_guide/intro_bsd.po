"Typically, Ansible will try to default to using OpenSSH as a connection "
"method. This is suitable when using SSH keys to authenticate, but when "
"using SSH passwords, Ansible relies on sshpass. Most versions of sshpass "
"do not deal particularly well with BSD login prompts, so when using SSH "
"passwords against BSD machines, it is recommended to change the transport"
" method to paramiko. You can do this in ansible.cfg globally or you can "
"set it as an inventory/group/host variable. For example::"

"Operating without Python is possible with the ``raw`` module. Although "
"this module can be used to bootstrap Ansible and install Python on BSD "
"variants (see below), it is very limited and the use of Python is "
"required to make full use of Ansible's features."

"As mentioned above, you can bootstrap Ansible with the ``raw`` module and"

"Python 2.7 which includes the json library required for full "
"functionality of Ansible. On your control machine you can execute the "

"This example demonstrated using pkg on FreeBSD and pkg_add on OpenBSD, "

"To support a variety of Unix/Linux operating systems and distributions, "
"Ansible cannot always rely on the existing environment or ``env`` "
"variables to locate the correct Python binary. By default, modules point "
"at ``/usr/bin/python`` as this is the most common location. On BSD "
"variants, this path may differ, so it is advised to inform Ansible of the"
" binary's location, through the ``ansible_python_interpreter`` inventory "
"variable. For example::"

"If you use additional plugins beyond those bundled with Ansible, you can "

"The majority of the core Ansible modules are written for a combination of"
