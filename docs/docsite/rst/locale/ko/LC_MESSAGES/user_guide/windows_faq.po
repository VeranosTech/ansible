"Use ``become``, which runs a command as it would when run locally. This "

" running under WinRM when ``become`` is used. See the :doc:`become` "
"documentation for more information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/windows_faq.rst:99
msgid ""
"Use a scheduled task, which can be created with ``win_scheduled_task``. "
"Like ``become``, it will bypass all WinRM restrictions, but it can only "
"be used to run commands, not modules."
msgstr ""

"To access network resources without any of these workarounds, an "
