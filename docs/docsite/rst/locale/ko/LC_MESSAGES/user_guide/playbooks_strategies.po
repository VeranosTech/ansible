"By default, Ansible runs each task on all hosts affected by a play before"
" starting the next task on any host, using 5 forks. If you want to change"
" this default behavior, you can use a different strategy plugin, change "
"the number of forks, or apply one of several play-level keywords like "
"``serial``."

"Several play-level :ref:`keyword<playbook_keywords>` also affect play "
"execution. The most common one is ``serial``, which sets a number, a "
"percentage, or a list of numbers of hosts you want to manage at a time. "
"Setting ``serial`` with any strategy directs Ansible to 'batch' the "
"hosts, completing the play on the specified number or percentage of hosts"
" before starting the next 'batch'. This is especially useful for "
":ref:`rolling updates<rolling_update_batch_size>`."

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.rst:41

"The second keyword to affect execution is ``throttle``, which can also be"
" used at the block and task level. This keyword limits the number of "
"workers up to the maximum set via the forks setting or ``serial``. This "
"can be useful in restricting tasks that may be CPU-intensive or interact "
"with a rate-limiting API::"

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.rst:47

"Other keywords that affect play execution include ``ignore_errors``, "
"``ignore_unreachable``, and ``any_errors_fatal``. Please note that these "
