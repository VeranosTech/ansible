"At a basic level, playbooks can be used to manage configurations of and "

"actions to other hosts, interacting with monitoring servers and load "
"balancers along the way."

"Playbooks are designed to be human-readable and are developed in a basic "

"files they include, and we'll offer up some suggestions on that and "
"making the most out of Ansible."
