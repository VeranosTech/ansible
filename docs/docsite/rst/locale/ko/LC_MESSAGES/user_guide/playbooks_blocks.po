"Blocks allow for logical grouping of tasks and in play error handling. "
"Most of what you can apply to a single task (with the exception of loops)"
" can be applied at the block level, which also makes it much easier to "
"set data or directives common to the tasks. This does not mean the "
"directive affects the block itself, but is inherited by the tasks "
"enclosed by a block. i.e. a `when` will be applied to the tasks, not the "
"block itself."

"In the example above, each of the 3 tasks will be executed after "
"appending the `when` condition from the block and evaluating it in the "
"task's context. Also they inherit the privilege escalation directives "
"enabling \"become to root\" for all the enclosed tasks."

"Names for tasks within blocks have been available since Ansible 2.3. We "

msgid ""
"Blocks also introduce the ability to handle errors in a way similar to "
"exceptions in most programming languages. Blocks only deal with 'failed' "
"status of a task. A bad task definition, an undefined variable or an "
"unreachable host are not `rescuable`  errors."

"The tasks in the ``block`` would execute normally, if there is any error "
"the ``rescue`` section would get executed with whatever you need to do to"
" recover from the previous error. The ``always`` section runs no matter "
"what previous error did or did not occur in the ``block`` and ``rescue`` "
"sections. It should be noted that the play continues if a ``rescue`` "
"section completes successfully as it 'erases' the error status (but not "
"the reporting), this means it won't trigger ``max_fail_percentage`` nor "
"``any_errors_fatal`` configurations but will appear in the playbook "
"statistics."
