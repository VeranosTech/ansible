"While it is possible to write a playbook in one very large file (and you "
"might start out learning playbooks this way), eventually you'll want to "
"reuse files and start to organize things. In Ansible, there are three "
"ways to do this: includes, imports, and roles."

"Includes and imports (added in Ansible version 2.4) allow users to break "
"up large playbooks into smaller files, which can be used across multiple "
"parent playbooks or even multiple times within the same Playbook."

"Roles allow more than just tasks to be packaged together and can include "
"variables, handlers, or even modules and other plugins. Unlike includes "

"Ansible has two modes of operation for reusable content: dynamic and "
"static."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_reuse.rst:25
msgid ""
"In Ansible 2.0, the concept of *dynamic* includes was introduced. Due to "
"some limitations with making all includes dynamic in this way, the "
"ability to force includes to be *static* was introduced in Ansible 2.1. "
"Because the *include* task became overloaded to encompass both static and"
" dynamic syntaxes, and because the default behavior of an include could "
"change based on other options set on the Task, Ansible 2.4 introduces the"
" concept of ``include`` vs. ``import``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../rst/user_guide/playbooks_reuse.rst:27
msgid ""
"If you use any ``import*`` Task (``import_playbook``, ``import_tasks``, "
"etc.), it will be *static*. If you use any ``include*`` Task "
"(``include_tasks``, ``include_role``, etc.), it will be *dynamic*."
msgstr ""

"The bare ``include`` task (which was used for both Task files and "
"Playbook-level includes) is still available, however it is now considered"

"Roles are a somewhat special case. Prior to Ansible 2.3, roles were "
"always statically included via the special ``roles:`` option for a given "
"play and were always executed first before any other play tasks (unless "
"``pre_tasks`` were used). Roles can still be used this way, however, "
"Ansible 2.3 introduced the ``include_role`` option to allow roles to be "
"executed inline with other tasks."

"The primary advantage of using ``include*`` statements is looping. When a"
