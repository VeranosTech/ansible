"is used to up a remote copy of ansible on each managed node, each set to "
"run via cron and update playbook source via a source repository. This "

"architecture, which has near-limitless scaling potential."

"The setup playbook can be tuned to change the cron frequency, logging "
"locations, and parameters to ansible-pull. This is useful both for "
"extreme scale-out as well as periodic remediation. Usage of the 'fetch' "
"module to retrieve logs from ansible-pull runs would be an excellent way "
"to gather and analyze remote logs from ansible-pull."
